# PR-Checklists
How to add checklists to your pull requests to organize and track your work

## Step 1: Make your initial commit

## Step 2: Create a pull request
Click the "New pull request" button, make sure you've selected the right branch (usually you should only have one -- the master branch) and then click "Create pull request."

## Step 3: Add a title and checklist(s) to your new pull request
The title should be your first and last name. In the comment field, copy and paste the provided checklist(s). If you want to add other items or notes to self, go ahead! When you're done, click the "Create pull request" button.

## Step 4: Use that checklist!
The checklist should now be interactive. When you've completed a task, check off the box next to that task:
![checklist](/checkboxes.jpg)<br/><br/>
Now, if you look at the list of pull requests, it's easy to track your progress:
